# The Before

You're a scientist, you're writing and publishing papers. You know how it works.
For the others, let me have a shot at explaining it.

Scientific research and publication is typically a waterfall process. It follows a number of steps
from idea to elaboration, actual testing and data analysis. Then an article has to be written, submitted,
peer-reviewed and finally published (or not). There is often a few rounds of comments from reviewers,
rework and resubmission until it is officially accepted (or rejected).

The cycle from idea to publication can be anywhere from a few months to many years. And a number of these
researches will never see the day of light for various reasons.

# The Now

[uScient.org](http://uscient.org) was just launched!

It is only a preview for now, but we expect you'll be able to start writing your articles and have them
peer-reviewed and publish in the near future.

Why not start the publication process early? Draft your hypothesis and method, and have it reviewed today.
You'll get valuable feedback and leave a permanent mark showing you had the idea first. Evolve your
article online as you collect new data and refine your analysis.

It's all public but not anonymous. You'll need a verified account and your contributions will be link
to you, so be nice ;)

It's free. No subscription fees. No publication fees. No lost of copyright.

# The After

Open source publishing can become really popular. When reputable scientists and big institutions embrace the idea,
it is gonna be the medium of choice for small and big research projects.
